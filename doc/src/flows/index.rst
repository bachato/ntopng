Flow Collection
###############

Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) generate NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX, or other flow data. However, ntopng is primarily a flow collector, analyzer, and visualizer—it's not optimized to act as a high-performance, dedicated flow probe or collector from many devices simultaneously. While ntopng can listen to flows directly in small setups, for any serious, scalable, or feature-rich deployment (especially requiring application identification), nProbe is an essential companion. It handles the "dirty work" of collection and processing, allowing ntopng to excel at visualization and analysis.
